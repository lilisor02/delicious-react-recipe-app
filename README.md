## Why is it?

I wanted to improve my overall React knowledge toolbox and how the React hooks work, and this project seemed like the one to do this.

## Challenges

It was my first time creating a React application, and learning how to think in React was a bit complicated at first. It's very different from Vanilla JavaScript, so the challenge I faced was to learn how components work and how to link everything.

## Technologies used

React, HTML, CSS. Hooks used are useState and useEffect.

## Installation

Installing npm

```bash
npm install
```

Starting the application

```bash
npm start
```
